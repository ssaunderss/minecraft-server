# minecraft-server
Host your own minnecraft server on AWS to save money 


Hey you, yeah you! Want to create your own minecraft server without paying for a realm? Looking for an overkill solution to impress your friends? Look no further! 

## Requirements
1. Terraform (will also use Terraform Cloud in this writeup for deploying)
2. AWS account 

## Todos:
[ ] Terraform Files
[ ] Scripts for AWS Lambda for dynamic startup / shutdown 
[ ] Maybe a micro Elixir Server that takes care of startup / shutdown instead of AWS for fun
